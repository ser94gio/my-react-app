        Hi my name is Sergio DeSousa-Rosa Jr. I am 29 years old and from the State of Rhode Island where I attened
        the University of Rhode Island. I enjoy spending time outdoors, going to various farmers
        markets, traveling, and learning about new and interesting fact. <br></br><br></br>
        I graduated the University 
        of Rhode Island with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2024. I have been working towards the goal
        of obtaining my bachelors degree for the last 5 years, along with obtaining my Associates in General Studies and 
        Computer Studies and Information Processing with a focus of computer programming from the Community College of Rhode
        Island. I am very proud of these accomplishments, beacause:<br></br>

      <ol className='about-list'>
        <li>I completed all this before I was 30</li>
        <li>I beat the odds and obtained a college <br></br>
        degree even after dropping out of college in 2017
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        My next goal in life is to find a job within the computer science field hopefully doing some form of developing code and enjoy 
        my 30's. Hopefully along the way I hope to meet more interesting people and gain further knowledge within the computer science
        field which I can implement into my own code. Thank you again for visting my site and hope you have a great rest of your day.
